    <p>Because I am originally from South Korea, I do listen to a lot of Korean songs, especially Korean ballad songs.
I was influenced by my parents who used to listen to these songs.</p>

    <p>My friends told me why listen to sad songs when you can listen to happy and fun songs that can cheer you up?
        I don't just listen to Korean ballad songs because I want to listen to sad songs. I listen to these because I was amazed on how a type of music can touch one's heart. I also feel comforted when I am listening to these songs.</p>
